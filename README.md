Subject: Request for Approval of Outside Employment

Dear Supervisor Johnson,

I hope you’re doing well. I am writing to request approval for outside employment beginning next year.

I have been offered an opportunity to teach one remote/hybrid class per semester at a local community college in the field of Mathematics or Data Science. The class would meet once a week, either in the evening or on Saturday, and I will ensure that it does not conflict with my regular duty hours or affect my availability, performance, or responsibilities in my current position.

I will not use any government resources, equipment, or time for this outside employment, and I will adhere to all applicable ethics rules, conflict-of-interest regulations, and agency policies.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are specific forms or procedures I should complete to formalize this request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
